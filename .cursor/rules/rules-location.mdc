# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new Cursor rules to this project:

1. Always place rule files in **PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/**:

    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── project-guidelines.mdc
    ├── rules-location.mdc
    ├── some-feature-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Naming convention:

    - Use **kebab-case** for filenames.
    - Always use the **.mdc** extension.
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose.

3. Directory structure:

    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── project-guidelines.mdc
    │       ├── rules-location.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── src/...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:

    - In the project root.
    - In subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`.
    - In any other location.

5. Rule file structure:

    ````

    # Rule Title

    Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

    1. Step-by-step instructions
    2. Code examples
    3. Guidelines
    ````

6. Keep rule files compact and scannable:

    - Target size: 100–200 lines.
    - Maximum: ~300 lines for complex rules.
    - Focus on essentials; avoid redundancy.
    - Prefer concise bullet lists and examples.
