# ros-drone

Hippocampal-inspired navigation experiments written in Python with optional ROS 2 integration. The core package (`hippocampus_core`) simulates a 2D arena, Gaussian place cells, coactivity tracking, and a topological graph builder. ROS 2 nodes in `hippocampus_ros2` wrap these controllers for robot experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the project in editable mode with dev extras:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```
   This installs `hippocampus_core` from the `src/` layout along with core dependencies (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`) and dev tooling (`pytest`, `nox`). Optional extras such as `torch`/`snntorch` can be added as needed.

## Running the Core Simulation

Execute the standalone simulator:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Plot Cheat-Sheet

- *Trajectory:* agent path through the rectangular arena.
- *Place-cell centres:* sampled Gaussian receptive fields laid over the arena.
- *Topological graph:* nodes are place-cell centres; edges appear when coactivity exceeds the configured threshold and the cells lie within the allowed spatial distance.

## Testing

Fast unit tests cover firing rates, coactivity, topology construction, and the place-cell controller. After the editable install, run:

```bash
pytest
```

or, for a clean-room run:

```bash
nox -s tests
```

## Experiments and Models

- Spiking-controller experiments (e.g. online R-STDP) live under `experiments/`.
- Store trained snnTorch or PyTorch checkpoints under `experiments/checkpoints/` (create the folder if needed) and point controller configs to those paths.

## ROS 2 Integration

The `ros2_ws/src/hippocampus_ros2` package provides an `ament_python` node (`snn_brain_node`) that subscribes to odometry and publishes velocity commands. See `ros2_ws/src/hippocampus_ros2/README.md` for build instructions, parameters, topic inspection tips, and a developer smoke-test walkthrough.
